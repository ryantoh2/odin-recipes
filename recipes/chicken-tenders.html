        <h3>Making quick and easy chicken tenders</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lb chicken tenders</li>
                <li>1 c. buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2c. all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp. seasoed salt, divided</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a zip-top plastic bag, combine the chicken tenders, buttermilk, 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt, and ½ teaspoon of pepper. Seal and massage the buttermilk mixture into the tenders. Let marinate for 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours, in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place the flour on a small plate. In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs. In another wide, shallow bowl, combine the panko, parmesan, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. </li>
                <li>Using a pair of tongs, remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade (reserve the marinade) and place the chicken in a single layer on a paper-towel lined plate. Pour the remaining buttermilk marinade into the bowl with the eggs and whisk to combine.</li>
                <li>Working with 2 to 3 tenders at a time, dredge all over in the flour, dip in the egg mixture to coat completely, then dredge to coat completely in the panko mixture. Repeat until all the tenders are breaded. Spray all over both sides of each tender with cooking spray (olive oil spray gives great flavor!).</li>
                <li>Working in 2 batches, place the tenders in a single layer, with about 1/2 inch of space between each. Cook in the air fryer set at 380°F for 8 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reads 165°F, 4 to 6 minutes more. Repeat with the second batch of tenders. Serve immediately with dipping sauces such as honey mustard, BBQ sauce, and ranch dressing. </li>
            </ol>
